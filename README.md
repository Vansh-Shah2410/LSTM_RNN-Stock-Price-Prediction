# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

**Project Overview**
-
The financial market is a complex and dynamic system where individuals and institutions can trade various assets such as stocks, currencies, and derivatives. The stock market provides opportunities for investors to buy shares of public companies, offering the potential for substantial profits with lower initial investment compared to starting a business or pursuing a high-salary career. However, the market is highly volatile, influenced by numerous factors, leading to uncertainty and risk.

Automated Trading Systems (ATS), driven by computer programs, are increasingly used for trading, as they can execute orders faster and with higher efficiency than humans. These systems need to be carefully evaluated and monitored to ensure risk management, relying on human judgment and specific safety measures. Developing an effective ATS involves various elements, such as trading strategies, mathematical models that reflect the stockâ€™s state, machine learning algorithms for predicting future stock values, and news sentiment analysis related to the stock.

**Project Objective**
-
Time Series forecasting and modeling play a crucial role in data analysis, particularly in economics and operations research. Stock prices are inherently volatile, influenced by a range of unpredictable factors. This project aims to predict future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its capability to capture temporal dependencies in time series data. The goal is to create an automated system that predicts stock trends with greater accuracy and efficiency.

**Key Features**
-
* LSTM-based Model: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock price movements, leveraging its ability to model sequential data and retain past information.
* Time Series Forecasting: Applies time series analysis techniques to predict stock price fluctuations over time.
* Data Integration: Incorporates historical stock data and external factors such as news sentiment or trading volumes to enhance prediction accuracy.
* Automated Trading Insights: Helps investors and traders make informed decisions based on predictive analytics.

**Tools & Technologies**
-
* Python: The primary programming language used for model implementation and data processing.
* Keras/TensorFlow: Libraries for building and training the LSTM model.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* NumPy: For numerical computations.
* Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model predictions.
 
By using machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance the forecasting of stock prices, providing valuable insights that can be used for automated trading systems and improving decision-making in stock market investments.
